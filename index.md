# DxClub Cyber Challenge: 3Puzzles3Suspects

**Disclaimer:** This story is a work of fiction. Names, characters, businesses, events, and incidents are the product of DxClub's imagination!

In the lovely town of UCVulnerville, there lives a community of hard working people who seek nothing but a good and peaceful life with their friends and family. UCVulnerville only has one bank, the UCVulnerville Bank, so a lot of the town's population resorts to storing their gold, jewelry, and other high value items in this secure bank. That was until a person came to the bank with guns blazing and stole everyone's high valued items!! We have no clue who committed the crime, but whoever did is a **MENACE TO UCVULNERVILLE!!**

There is no evidence except for three puzzles left behind by the criminal. As of now, we have a lead on three potential suspects, but our skills are limited and we need your help. As the UCVulnerville forensics analyst, it is your job to analyze this evidence to help us come to a conclusion on who is the culprit of this crime. We have our full trust in you!

## Suspects

This is our list of suspects, make sure to take a good look at them, we cannot be mistaken and risk having the criminal escape with the stolen items.

## Josh Richards
Josh Richards is a 28-year-old former kitchen chef who is extremely addicted to chocolate. Brad has lost three jobs as a result of his addiction and is not doing too well financially. Just a week ago, he was posting on social media about his financial struggles and how he was planning on doing the next big thing. At first we thought he was talking about looking for a new job or hobby, but things are too coincidental for him not to be a potential suspect in this crime.

## Alissa Castillo
Alissa Castillo is 34 years old and has a bachelor's degree in finance. She works at the UCVulnerville Bank and is known to be a very hardworking woman. For the past year, she has received the Employee of the Month award every single month! However, lately she has been very suspicious. Just a couple days ago, she was caught trying to sneak into the vault holding the high-value items that were stolen. Only security guards and other officials are allowed in the vault. That is clearly a red flag tp us, hence why she is one of the potential suspects.

### Scott Stanley
Scott Stanley is a 30-year old gambler whose life is dominated by trying to make mass amounts of money. People can't even count the number of times this man has started a business and failed miserably. Two months ago, at a local cafe, Scott was bragging about how he invested a lot of money into GameStop (GME), the infamous stock of the year. Little did he know, the stock came crashing down the next week causing him to lose his life savings in sheer minutes. Because of this, he's become a very angry man who complains about everything and thinks the world is against him. We think there is enough reason for him to be a potential suspect.

## Evidence Puzzles

Here are the evidence files we found. Be sure to split the work if in a team, team work makes the dream work!

### Password Card

Before the robbery, the criminal hacked into the bank's servers and managed to set their own password for accessing the vault. We found this card right next to the keypad leading to the vault, these cards are typically used for password management systems. The criminal must've used this card to remember his password!

Here is the encrypted password we found on our servers, decipher it!

### Random Equation
We found a note next to the front desk with an equation on one side and with all these numbers on the other. Could those numbers be [ASCII numbers](http://www.asciitable.com/) representing characters? What would be the best approach in solving this mess of a puzzle?

Hint: For loops + chr() is your best friend :D

### Hexadecimal Graph
This random graph image was found in our servers alongside with a hexadecimal number. Our guess is that the criminal left this image as a signature of their attack. Could this graph have some form of direction? How can the hexadecimal help us?

Hint: Hex -> binary -> decimal
