# DxClub Cyber Challenge: 3Puzzles3Suspects

**Disclaimer:** This story is a work of fiction. Names, characters, businesses, events, and incidents are the product of DxClub's imagination!

In the lovely town of UCVulnerville, lives a community of hard working people who seek nothing but a good life with their friends and family. UCVulnerville only has one bank, the UCVulnerville Bank, so a lot of the population have their gold, jewelry, and other high value items stored in this secure bank. That was until a person came to the  bank guns blazing and stole everyone's high valued items!! We have no clue who committed the crime, but whoever did is a **MENACE TO UCVULNERVILLE!!**

There is no evidence except for three puzzles left behind by the criminal. This led us to three potential suspects, but our skills are limited and we need your help. As the UCVulnerville forensic analyst, it is your job to analyze this evidence to help us come to a conclusion on who is the culprit of this crime. We have our full trust in you!

## Suspects

This is our list of suspects, make sure to take a good look at them, we cannot be mistaken and risk having the criminal escape with the stolen items.

### Scott Stanley
Scott Stanley is a 30-year old gambler whose life is dominated by trying to make mass amounts of money. People can't even count the number of times this man has started a business and failed miserably. Two months ago, at a local cafe, Scott was bragging about how he invested a lot of money into GameStop (GME), the infamous stock of the year. Little did he know, the stock came crashing down the next week causing him to lose his life savings in sheer minutes. Because of this, he's become a very angry man who complains about everything and thinks the world is against him. We think there is enough reason for him to be a potential suspect.

## Alissa Castillo
Alissa Castillo is 34 years old and has a bachelor's degree in finance. She works at the UCVulnerville Bank and is known to be a very hardworking woman. For the past year, she has received the Employee of the Month award every single month! However, lately she has been very suspicious. Just a couple days ago, she was caught trying to sneak into the vault holding the high-value items that were stolen. Only security guards and other officials are allowed in the vault. That is clearly a red flag tp us, hence why she is one of the potential suspects.

## Josh Richards
Josh Richards is a 28-year-old former kitchen chef who is extremely addicted to chocolate. Brad has lost three jobs as a result of his addiction and is not doing too well financially. Just a week ago, he was posting on social media about his financial struggles and how he was planning on doing the next big thing. At first we thought he was talking about looking for a new job or hobby, but things are too coincidental for him not to be a potential suspect in this crime.
